                <p>No matter how easy-going you are, life can get stressful. And when stress takes over, even for those who appear to have the calmest center, it can be a chore to find your Zen again. To help you get there faster, here are 5 calming quotes for peaceful vibes.</p>

                <h4>Be still.</h4>

                <h4>Have faith.</h4>
                <p>"Breath is the power behind all things. I breathe in and know that good things will happen." —Tao Porchon-Lynch</p>
                
                <h4>Be yourself.</h4>
                <p>"Within you, there is a stillness and a sanctuary to which you can retreat at any time and be yourself." —Hermann Hesse</p>

                <h4>Breathe.</h4>
                <p>"Feelings come and go like clouds in a windy sky. Conscious breathing is my anchor." —Thích Nhất Hạnh</p>
