                <h4>Practice, practice, practice.</h4>
                <p>Need I say more? (probably not, but I'm going to anyway.) The more the merrier! As we practice, concepts
                    that were once challenging become second nature. The more we practice the faster we become. We also begin
                    to see efficiencies in our own workflow that we did not see before.
                </p>

                <h4>Savor the challenge.</h4>
                <p>I'm not going to lie. At times, it will hurt! It will seem like no matter what you try you just can't find that
                    one error. You may spend hours with it. But, once you "get it", that particulary error is soooo much less likely
                    to happen the next time. If it does, the time needed to find and correct it will be greatly abbreviated. Hang
                    in there, it gets easier!
