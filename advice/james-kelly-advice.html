            <h4>Embrace the challenge</h4>
            <p>If it was easy it would become boring and meaningless, challenge is what grows you and makes you wiser.
            </p>

            <p>To stay positive, set smaller goals, celebrate when you achieve them, and express gratitude often.
            </p>

            <h4>Fake it til you make it.</h4>
            <p>Most of life is fake it till you make it. You do the best you can, you screw up, you learn lessons, and
                you repeat. Eventually you get really good.
