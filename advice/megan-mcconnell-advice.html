                <h4>Take Notes</h4>
                <p> Take notes in your own voice to help you remember the flow of things.</p>
                <h4>Draw Diagrams and Flow Charts</h4>
                <p> Draw flow charts or diagrams to 
                    give yourself a visual about how things work.  It is an extra step, but it helps if you are a visual person
                    to remember new information  better.</p>
