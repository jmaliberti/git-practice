                <h4>It's all about the balance!</h4>
                <p>When I get really into learning a new, interesting skill I might be so into it that I might lose myself in the intent to finish all the modules in one evening.</p>
                <p>I might lose touch with feelings like thirst or hunger and just want to solve the next problem. </p>

                <h4>Remind myself of rest, air, food and movement.</h4>
                <p>I sometimes even put an alarm to interrupt my work flow and take care of my physical needs and go for a walk and look at, or interact with plants, animals or any living creature.
                </p>

                <p>During these processes I need to get to know myself and find out whats challenging for me and what can support me in it.</p>

                <p>Putting on my favourite clothes, chosing colours or aroma oils, jumping for 10 minutes- I want to find out what does me well and just do it. Which is not easy. hahahah</p>
