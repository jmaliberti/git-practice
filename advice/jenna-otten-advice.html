            <h1>Hi, my name is Jenna and I have some advice for you!</h1>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done
                    before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something
                    so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                    have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                    to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language, part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>My Personal Experience</h4>
                <p>It is easy to feel like you're not able to learn this material as fast as those around you, or not even at all. 
                    A mentor once told me something that I repeat to myself often as I learn to code..."Everyone usually gets the 
                    skills in their own time." 
                </p>

                <p>Everyone has their own experience with technology. It really depends on your experience going into any learning 
                    situation how fast you will pick it up. If you keep your curiosity for learning high, the motivation is natural.
                    Give yourself patience to learn these incredibly new skills. Comparing your learning to others will not serve you
                    in your goal of learning how to code, although these are the expectations that are set-up by a culture and industry
                    that is not-inclusive of many people. Trust your instincts and be confident in knowing how you learn. Take the time 
                    and steps necessary to make that happen and you will get there with repitition, curiosity and patience.
