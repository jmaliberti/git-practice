                <h4>Stick with it</h4>
                <p>When you first start programming, it will probably be a little confusing and challenging...</p>

                <p>But be sure to stick with it! Things will start to click, and it'll feel great when you accomplish new goals!</p>

            <div class="advice-two">
                <h4>Experiment</h4>
                <p>There's no need to rush through lessons and projects. Feel free to experiment: try new things, mess around, take things apart and see if you can put them back together again! Doing is a huge part of learning!</p>
