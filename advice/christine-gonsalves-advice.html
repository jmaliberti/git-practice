               <h4>Don't Give Up and Remember To Breathe!</h4>
               <p>Learning and absorbing new information can get overwhelming and downright frustrating at times. If you feel like you've been stuck for a bit, get up and stretch your legs for a while. Grab a snack. Throw on your favorite song and dance around the room. After you've calmed down you can sit back down, take a couple refreshing deep breaths, and get back at it in a more relaxed manner. It's much easier to spot errors with a clear mind!</p>

               <p>Don't let those nasty imposter syndrome demons make you think you can't make it through. They're just intrusive thoughts with an attitude problem. Take time to remind yourself that you're awesome and that you've got this!</p>
