                <h4>Organize</h4>
                <p>Normally, I have advice I give away freely because I just do not use it. Coding is on another level, however. I will share some of my tips and tricks but, at the end of the day, it is really what works for you. </p>

                <p>One, I take notes to stay organized and to have a reference. I also have a three-ring binder for printouts and "cheat sheets" that Skillcrush provides. Having resources in one or two spots saves time and lowers frustration levels.
                </p>

                <h4>Time Management</h4>
                <p>Two, set some dedicated time to work on the class. One or two hours a few days a week is very beneficial. If you have more time, go for it. Also, finish the section you start in one sitting. It helps with your flow and your sanity.
                </p>

                <p>Three, use Google if you are stuck. The answer is always available when you ask the question properly.</p>

                <p>Finally, have fun. It is truly a wonderful adventure. You got this1</p>
