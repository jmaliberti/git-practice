                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Learning to code is like learning a brand new language. It's going to be hard, but with time and patience it is definitely possible! Here we are, on this lesson, still kind of at the beginning of our journey into code, and look at how much we've been able to learn so far!</p>

                    <p>It's ok to feel like it may be too much or like you've gotten yourself in too deep. I still feel that way sometimes, but keep in mind, we're still early on our journey into code, so it's still kind of like we're getting our feet wet, right?</p>
                    
                    <p>This is all a part of the learning process, so keep telling yourself that it is prefectly acceptable to feel lost and confused, no matter what stage of the game we're in. If you're like me, asking for help can sometimes be difficult, but there are so many resources on learning to code, and we're all in the same boat, so lean on each other and ask those questions! We can figure it out and learn together.</p>
                    
                    

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>Don't let that little voice in the back of your head saying, "You can't do this, it's too much, find something else," get to you. You're doing great. If you feel lost or frustrated, it means you're learning and you're on the right track. So don't give up on yourself. Remind yourself why you started, take your time, learn the lessons, feel the feels, and keep that goal within reach.</p>

                    <p>We can do this.</p>
