            <h4>Everyone's Experience is Different</h4>
            <p>If there's one thing I've learned in life it's that everyone's experience is different. Just because
                someone had a bad experience, didn't like their job, couldn't find a job, etc doesn't mean that will be
                your story. People will tell you things all the time, and you can listen but don't have to internalize.
                What works or didn't work for someone else isn't what will or will not work for you.</p>
