            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before.
                It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific
                that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have
                engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig
                deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the
                code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of
                the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to
                train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
                understand what it's doing.</p>

            <h4>Try to find the answers first... Then ask an expert!</h4>
            <p>I find that getting "lost" along the way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encourages me look at the problem from different angles</li>
                <li>Teaches me to look for and find answers more effectively</li>
                <li>Reminds me to be patient. This is a new language and learning anything from scratch takes time and
                    practice!!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The trama almost always ensures the same mistake isn't made again! ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
            </p>

            <p>If all else fails, the wisdom of an expert brings a fantastic feeling of clarity and relief. Don't be
                afraid to ask!
            </p>

            <p>Also, search Slack! Someone at some point has undoubtedly asked the question you need answering!
            </p>

            <p id="tyann">Thanks to Ann (the Instructor!) for this amazingness!</p>
            <p>"To get to a folder you want to work in faster, find the particular folder that you want to work in in the
                File Explorer and then right-click on it and choose either "More options -> Git Bash Here" or just "Git
                Bash Here" depending on the version of your operating system."
